On one lonely Thursday afternoon, Charles was doing his job in Engineering hall, minding his own business.
Charles is not a person, however, and is in fact a cement pillar.
He has been holding up a portion of EHall since the building opened in 1952.
He has gone through many renovations, but has stood the test of time.
However, on that quiet Thursday afternoon, everything would change.
An architect walked into EHall and informed everyone that the building would
get a complete makeover and Charles was going to fall soon.
Charles was sad. He had stood for so long watching over UW-Madison engineering students, but 
his watch would soon be over. His dying wish was to ensure his replacement would continue 
to hold a roof over the students head as he had done for years. But, he when he 
met his replacement he knew there would be a problem.
His replacement didn't exist! Due to updated building codes and stronger materials,
Charles was no longer necessary, and his weight will be carried by others.
With this modern innovation, the reign of Charles was over. Everyone was sad to
see him go, but it was for the best. Rest in Piece, Charles
