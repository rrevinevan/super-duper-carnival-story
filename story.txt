On one lonely Thursday afternoon, Charles was doing his job in Engineering hall, minding his own business.
Charles is not a person, however, and is in fact a cement pillar.
He has been holding up a portion of EHall since the building opened in 1952.
He has gone through many renovations, but has stood the test of time.
However, on that quiet Thursday afternoon, everything would change.
An architect walked into EHall and informed everyone that the building would
get a complete makeover and Charles was going to fall soon.
